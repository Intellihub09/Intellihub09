## 💡 About Me

I’m passionate about building efficient, user-friendly tools that solve real problems — fast.  
Instead of reinventing the wheel, I believe in using the **power of no-code/low-code platforms** like **Trae AI**, **Cursor**, **Supabase**, and **Windsurf AI, etc..** to build, deploy, and scale apps quickly.

💼 Currently focused on:
- Creating useful **web & mobile apps** that boost productivity
- Exploring **multi-agent workflows** with AI and automation
- Building a **passive income stream** from smart, scalable tools
